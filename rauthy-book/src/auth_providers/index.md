# Upstream Authentication Providers

This section is about upstream authentication providers, for instance things like **Sign in with Github**.

This feature can be considered "in beta state" and the only setup guide is for Github for now.  
Additional ones may come, when people are using other providers and give feedback or actually contribute to these docs.
