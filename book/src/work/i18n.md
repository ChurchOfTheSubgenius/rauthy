# I18n

Rauthy supports translated views for all user-facing UI and E-Mails.

At the time of writing, there are english (default) and german. If you need another language, it can be implemented
pretty easily, as the project is prepared for that. You can either open a PR and provide all the necessary translations,
or if you are a company, you can reach out to me: `mail@sebadob.dev`.

What will never happen though is the implementation of an automated approach, because all these generated translations
are usually very bad. Also, when the migration to Leptos has been done at some point, adding new translations will get
easier, as I will reorganize the way it's done. Offline preparations have been made already.
