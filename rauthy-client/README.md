# rauthy-client

Minimal and safe by default client library for the Rauthy project.

This has not been released and should only be used for testing until the first release.

It is working with the `axum` framework for now and a first example for axum exists.  
However, at least `actix` will be added as a feature before the first release and the
API might change with the introduction with this feature as the next step.
